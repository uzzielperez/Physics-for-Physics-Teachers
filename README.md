# Physics-for-Physics-Teachers

A repository of teaching materials for high school physics.
Work-in-progress. Summer 2019.

If you only had an hour to learn physics, [Walter Lewin's Last Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyyWwpwxR8) could be your best bet. [Paul Hewitt's Conceptual Physics Workshop For Teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB6UBlzpklc) also offers practical advice on teaching physics.

## Topics
### Kinematics and Force Laws
