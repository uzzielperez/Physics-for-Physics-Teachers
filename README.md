# Physics-for-Physics-Teachers

A repository of teaching materials for high school physics.
Work-in-progress. Summer 2019.

If you only had an hour to learn physics, [Walter Lewin's Last Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyyWwpwxR8) could be your best bet. [Paul Hewitt's Conceptual Physics Workshop For Teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB6UBlzpklc) also offers practical advice on teaching physics.

## Topics
### Motion: Kinematics and Newton's Laws

### Electricity and Magnetism

Some teachers prefer starting from applied problems or more visual topics like optics before delving into more abstract concepts of charge and electric fields. You can decide if a top-down or a bottom-up approach is more suited for your style of teaching. If we look back on history, man's curiosity about electricity and magnetism started with "magic shows". They lifted pieces of paper with amber. They didn't really understand the first principles for a long while until some great scientists "sat down" to really study them.

Activities:
-  [Lenses](https://www.geogebra.org/m/dGdEMuUW#material/cPqeYrJQ) - online interactive simulation. An easy way to draw ray diagrams. <br>
- [Hologram Smart Phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omd-MhqCM88). It's based on the principle behind Pepper's Ghost. You can read more about it [here](https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/the-science-behind-the-pepper-s-ghost-illusion).
- [Total Internal Reflection]
