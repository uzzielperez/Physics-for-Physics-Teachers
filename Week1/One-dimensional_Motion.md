# Motion Essentials

#### 1-D kinematics
Not talking about which is a vector or a scalar. <br>
Just think about the idea of changing quantities and typical symbols.

| x     | v          | a  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|displacement/distance   | velocity/speed | acceleration |
|   | $`\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}`$ |   $`\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}`$|

The nice thing about classical physics is that there are many things that you can predict if you can measure a few quantities. For example, if you knew the intitial velocity of a ball, you'll be able to tell where it would be at some later time.
