# Motion Essentials

#### 1-D kinematics
Not talking about which is a vector or a scalar. <br>
Just think about the idea of changing quantities and typical symbols.

| x     | v          | a  |

|displacement/distance   | velocity/speed | acceleration |

The nice thing about classical physics is that there are many things that you can predict if you can measure a few quantities. For example, if you knew the intitial velocity of a ball, you'll be able to tell where it would be at some later time.

We could list the equations but at this point it would be more useful to start with graphs to give an intuitive understanding of the most fundamental equations above.

This online activity - [Uniform Acceleration in One Dimension](https://www.geogebra.org/m/bV3nXswB#material/d7vZRB8r) is an excellent and simple way to visualize how the position and velocity changes over time for a car with a certain acceleration. Try to play with the settings and see if you can come up with different scenarios that you can explore in hands-on exercises with your students.
