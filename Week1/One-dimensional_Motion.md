#### 1-D kinematics
Not talking about which is a vector or a scalar. <br>
Just think about the idea of changing quantities and typical symbols.

The nice thing about classical physics is that there are many things that you can predict if you can measure a few quantities. For example, if you knew the intitial velocity of a ball, you'll be able to tell where it would be at some later time.
